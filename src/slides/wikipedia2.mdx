    _Generative art_ refers to art that in whole or in part has been created
    with the use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system in this context
    is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features
    of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the
    artist. In some cases the human creator may claim that the generative system
    represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on
    the role of the creator.
